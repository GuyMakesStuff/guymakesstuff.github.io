    <h2 id="About Segment">
        Hello!</br>
        I'm GuyMakesStuff, And I Like To Code.</br>
        I Have Always Had An Intrest In Computers And Other</br>
        Electronic Things, And Started Programming <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2020)</script> Years Ago,</br>
        As I Was Looking For Something To Do During Lockdown.</br>
        </br>
        I Originally Begun Coding On An EDU Website Called "CodeMonkey",</br>
        Where I Have Learned The Basics Of Coding And Made My First Games.</br>
        </br>
        <img src = "Images/About/CodeMonkey_1.png" width="800px"></br>
        </br>
        <img src = "Images/About/CodeMonkey_2.png" width="800px"></br>
        </br>
        I Wanted To Try Out Something New After A While, And In September 2020</br>
        I Discovered The Unity Engine Through Youtube Videos. So I Downloaded</br>
        The Engine And Begun Learning Through Youtube Tutorials How To Make More Advanced Games.</br>
        However, This Did Not Go As Planned As I Had A Hard Time Learning Due To The Hard Transition</br>
        From And EDU Website To A Proper Game Engine, And Those Games Were Crude Copy-Pastes From Tutorials</br>
        And Were Never Finished.</br>
        </br>
        After A While Of Unfinished Projects, I Decided That I Was Too Ambitious With What I Tried To Do,</br>
        So In November, I Took On Myself A Smaller Project, Begun Learning Through Better Tutorials, And After 2-4 Days,</br>
        "Jungle Sphere" Was Finished. A Crude Joke Racing Game Made With The Brackeys "Make A Game" Series.</br>
        </br>
        <img src = "Images/About/JungleSphere.png" width="800px"></br>
        </br>
        After A While Of Working On Another Unfinished Project, I Had An Idea:</br>
        "Hmm... What If I Took My Funny Jungle Sphere Game And Put It On Itch IO?</br>
        It Will Probably Be So Successfull, The Big Boy Youtubers Are Going To Play</br>
        This Game Because Of Its Absurdity, And I Will Become Famous!"</br>
        So, On January 7th 2021, I Have Created The GuyMakesStuff Itch IO Account While In</br>
        A Zoom Class In School, And Released The Game Titling It "The Worst Game Ever Made".</br>
        After Releasing The Game, I Immediately Went Over To The Analytics. The Downloads And Views Should Appear Anytime Soon...</br>
        </br>
        The Game Got No Downloads (That Were Not Myself).</br>
        I Have Removed The Game From Itch IO In December 2021 Because I Really Didn't Like It.</br>
        </br>
        I Did Not Give Up, And Around A Month Of More Unfinished Games Later, I Have Released</br>
        My Second Game-"Exellent Decompile". Still Barely Any Downloads.</br>
        </br>
        After Releasing Four More Games, Slowly Lowering My Expectations, I Have Decided To Join The "Jamulator 2021" Game Jam.</br>
        </br>
        <img src="Images/About/Jamulator.png" width = "800px"></br>
        </br>
        I Thought That Joining A Game Jam Could Increase My Chance Of Being Recodnized, And Probably Will Help Me Improve My Skills.</br>
        So On May 1st 2021, I Have Released My Entry To The Jam-"Chicken Parent Simulator".</br>
        </br>
        <img src="Images/About/ChickParentSim.png" width = "800px"></br>
        </br>
        And... It Worked! Sure, The Game Was Farely Low Rated, And Didn't Get A Lot Of Downloads,</br>
        However Some People Played It, And I Got Some Of My Very First Feedback On My Games!</br>
        </br>
        <img src="Images/About/Feedback.png" width="800px"></br>
        </br>
        Ever Since Then I Have Made A Variaty Of Games. From A Topdown Shooter Where Everything Is V,</br>
        To A Platformer Where Every Single Gameplay Element Is An Upgrade. From A 3D Recreation Of Snake,</br>
        To An FPS Where You Fend Of Images From Your Computer!</br>
        </br>
        <img src="Images/About/Collection.png" width = "800px"></br>
        </br>
        More Reacently, At Around December 2022,</br>
        I Have Taken A Break From Working On Games To Learn About More Programming Related Subjects,</br>
        Like Low Level Electronics Programming With Arduino, And Javascript Web Development (I.E This Website).</br>
        BASICALLY WHATEVER I WANT TO DO!</br>
        </br>
        Anyways, That Was My Story Until Nowadays. You Can Use This Website To Find Out About My Projects,</br>
        Or To Find Me On My Socials. Hope You Have Fun :)
