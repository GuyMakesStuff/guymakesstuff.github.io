    Hallways is An Expiremental Game Where You Must Collect As many Coins As You Can</br>
    Under The Given Time Limit In An Endless Randomly Generated Maze.</br>
    </br>
    You Can Also Customize The Game's Settings Like Coin Spawn Rates And Different Time Limits,</br>
    Or Enable "Explorer Mode", If You Want To Simply Explore Around The Endless Hallway Without A Time Limit 
    Or Coins To Collect.</br>

    I Was Expirementing With Generating An Endless Porcedural Hallway In Unity. I Thought About How I Could Turn 
    This Expirement Into A Game, And I Decided That The Player Will To Find Coins In The Maze-Like Hallway Under A Given Time Limit To Earn Score. 
    I Also Expiremented With Creating Almost All game UI Using Code, So That Was Fun.</br>

    If You Are Wondering How The Generation Works, We Start With A Single Hallway Of A Random Length, 
    And Then We Choose One Or More Points In Set Hallway And Check If There is Anything Near Them. 
    Then, If Possible, We Delete The Hallway's Wall At Every Chosen Point In A Given Direction, And Create A New Hallway 
    Of A Random Length In That Direction, Where This Process Is Repeated. We Also Trim The new Hallway If It Intersects With Previously 
    Generated Hallways, And Spawn Coins At Dead Ends.</br>

    Overall, Despite This Game Being Different From What I Usually Make, I Had Fun Working On It,</br>
    And I Want To Create Expirements Like It In The Future.
