    Chicken Parent Simulator Is A Game Where You Must Go Out Into The Road 
    And Collect Seed So You Can Feed Yourself And Your Babies, While Also Avoiding Incoming Cars And</br>
    Only Being Able To Carry Around 15 Seeds.</br>
    </br>
    Development Of The Game Started On Late April 2021, When I Decided To Join The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/jamulator-2021">Jamulator 2021</a></br>
    Game Jam, A Week Long Competition On Itch IO Where You Must Make A Simulation Game And Publish It Before The Deadline. 
    This Was My First Time Participating In An Online Game Jam, And I Joined It Because I Wanted To See If Joining A Jam 
    Could Help My Games Get Noticed, And Also To Learn Some New Skills.</br>

    For My Game, I Decided To Play On The Classic "Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road" Line, And Decided That 
    The Player Will Play As A Mother Chicken Risking Her Life By Going Into The Road To Collect Seeds For Herself 
    And Her Babies.</br>

    I Worked very Hard On The Game, And Learned Many New Skills Along The Way Like Pixel Art,</br>
    Playing Audio Through An Audio Manager, Drawing Pixel Art, And More! In The End I, Ended Up</br>
    Releasing The Game 3 Days Before The Deadline On May 1st, And Although The Game Was Low Rated 
    And Got Little Downloads, It Was The First Game I Have Recieved Proper Feedback On From Players, 
    And I Got To Know That Some People Actually Played The Game And Liked It.</br>

    Overall, I Think That My First Time Doing A Game Jam Was Successful, And I Have Learned A Lot Along The Way!
