    Cubix Is A Game Where You Cube. Why A Cube? Where A Cube? It Doesn't Matter.</br>
    It Also Doen't Have A Meaning. You Are Just A Cube In The Endless Empty Depressing World Of More Cubes 
    That Is Around You.</br>
    </br>
    The Idea For This Game Was Born When I Was Looking At Search Results For My First Game "Jungle Sphere", 
    And Stumbled Across A Game Simply Called <a href="https://sutopat.itch.io/spheres">Spheres</a> - 
    A Wierd Abstract Seamingly Meaningless Game Where You Move Around Spheres In An Endless Random Sequence Of The Same Levels, 
    With Monotonic Sounds In The Background, And A Depressing Color Pallatte And Atmosphere.</br>

    </br>
    I Didn't Really Feel Anything About The Game, And I didn't Understand It,</br>
    However I Still Felt Like Recreating It, Just With Cubes Instead Of Spheres!</br>
    </br>
    Inspired By Spheres, The Game Used A Depressing Limited Color Pallatte With A Long Seemingly</br>
    Endless Route Of Levels That Don't Seem To Have A Particular Goal. Tough At The Time I Didn't</br>
    Know That Spheres Was Endlessly Switching Between Levels And Had No End, So I Ended Up Maikng 
    26 Abstract Levels With Different Control Types And Gimmicks (One Of Which Is More Than 8 Minuts In Length).</br>

    </br>
    To Make The Game Stand Out And Inspired By Spheres Monotonic Tunes, I Made The Game Have An Emphasis On Sound, 
    Where The End Of Each Level Emits A Sound That Gets Louder The Closer You Get To It.</br>
    </br>
    For Example: In The Beginning Of The Game You Need To Reach An Invisible Trigger 5 Times Without Falling Of The Platform, 
    And You Must Find Where The Trigger Is Every Time By Carefully Listening For The Trigger's Sound And How Close It Sounds.</br>

    And That Was My Third Game. It Was Defenitly My First Serious Attempt At Making A Game, And I Had Fun Making It. 
    It May Be Meaningless, However It Was Sure A Unique Expirement.
