    Sunset Glow Is A Relaxing 2.5D Platfromer Where You Must Climb Up A Tall Mountain 
    By Switching Colors To Avoid Lazers And Stand On Platforms, While Taking In The Beautiful 
    Day And Night Cycle In The Background.</br>
    </br>
    I Got The Idea For This Game For The Official Brackeys Entry For The Brackeys game Jam 2 <a href="https://brackeysgames.itch.io/date-night">Date Night</a>, 
    Where The Two Characters Can Only Stand On Platforms In Their Given Color. I Wanted To Replicate This Idea, 
    Exept There Is Only One Character Who Can Switch Between The Two Colors.</br>
    </br>
    With The Graphics And Atmosphere Of This Game I Wanted To Improve On What I Did With <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=Basketennis">Afternoon Basketennis</a>, 
    And While The Graphics Still Are Not Super Photorealistic, They Still Look Way Better Than My First Attempt.</br>
    The General Feel Of The Game Is Also Way Better, With me Expirementing With A Day And Night Cycle In The Background
    And Creating Wierd Surreal Background Ambiant Noises.</br>

    All And All, I Think This Was A Way Better Game Than Afternoon Basketennis, And I Had A lot Of Fun Making It!
