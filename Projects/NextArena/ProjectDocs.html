    Nextarena Is A Game In Which You Battle Against Incoming Nextbots Made of Images 
    Directly From Your Computer On A Large Arena, And See For How Long Tou Can Survive 
    And How Many Can You Destroy!
    </br>
    </br>
    The Game Also Includes An Image Gallery To See Which Images You Have Managed To Kill 
    During Your Time Playing The Game, And How Many Times Have You Got The Same Image.

    I Got The Idea For This Game From A Game I Saw Called <a href="https://mjm.itch.io/detritus">Detritus</a>, 
    Which Looks Over Images On Your Computer And Turnes Them Into An "Art Gallery" 
    With Ghosts Flying Around:

    I Thought It Was Cool, And Thought: "What If These Images Could Chase Me Around In An Arena, 
    And I Will Need To Defend Them?" And So I Began Working On This Game. The Game Was More Of An Expirement 
    At Loading In Images From The Users Computer Rather Than A Serious Game, Yet It Was Suprisingly Fun To Kill 
    And Run Away From Images On My Computer, And I Guess Other People Thought So Because It Is My Most 
    Downloaded Game (At The Time Of Writing This). So Yeah, It Was A Fun Expirement :)
