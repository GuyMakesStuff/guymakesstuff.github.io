    Shoot2Live Is My First Finished 2D Game, 
    Where Your Health Slowly Drains Over Time And You Must Gain It Back By Shooting At Falling Bricks!</br>
    But Be Careful! If You Hit A Brick Your Health Will Drain Even More, And If You Fire Too Fast You Will 
    Need To Wait For Your Ammo To Recharge!</br>

    After Finishing Cubix, I Wanted To Make A 2D Game, As All Of My Previous Attempts At 2D In Unity Ended Up Unfinished. 
    So, I Watched A Brackeys Tutorial About Making A 2D Block Dodging Game, And Recreated It Myself!</br>
    </br>
    However, I Felt Like The Game Was Boring And Needed More To Set It Apart.</br>
    I Thought About The Idea That The Player Could Shoot The Blocks To Re-Gain Their Constantly Draining Health 
    With A Limited Amount Of Ammo That If Runs Out, They Will Need To Rely On Dodging The Blocks Without Refuelling Their Health.</br>

    I Thought The Idea Was Cool, And Added It To The Game. The Game Was Instantly Better!</br>
    I Also Added Score, A Rounds System, And Also An Easy Mode Which Allows You To Play The Game Without The Extra Gimmicks!</br>

    This Game Was Also My First Serious Attempt At Making Music. It Was The Quality You Would Expect, 
    However We All Got To Start Somewhere I Guess.</br>
    </br>
    So That Was My First 2D Game. Despite The Cool Gimmick, The Game Was very Repetetive And Had Barely Any Replay Value.</br>
    The Graphics Were Extremely Basic, The Music Was Loud And Annoying, The UI Didn't Scale Properly With The Screen, And The Game Was generally Buggy. 
    It Was Still Pretty Cool To Work On.
