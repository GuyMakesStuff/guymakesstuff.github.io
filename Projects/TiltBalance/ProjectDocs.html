    Tilt Balance Is A game Where You Have To Tilt The Ground Platform To Move 
    Your Ball Around And Make Sure It Doesn't Fall Off Or Gets Hit By The Falling Obstacles!</br>

    Originating In An Unfinished Project, I Thought It Would Be Cool That Instead of The Player Moving</br>
    The Ball Itself, They Will Have To Move The Ground Beneath It And Balance It Around. Combined With Falling Obstacles 
    That Force The Player To Constantly Move The Ball Around, I Thought It Will Lead To A Cool And interesting Game.</br>

    There Really Isn't A Lot More To This Game. Despite The Interesting Concept,</br>
    The Game Just Gets Repetetive After A While, And Thats Probably The Reason Why It Didn't</br>
    Get Downloaded (At The Time Of Writing). But I Still Kinda Like It For What it Is, So Yeah.
