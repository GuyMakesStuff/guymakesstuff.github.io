    Into The Sky Is A Game Where You Jump using The Mouse, And You Must Climb Up 
    Platforms As Far As You Can Before The Rising Lava Floor Reaches You!</br>
    </br>
    The Idea For This Game Originated In An Unfinished Project Named "Tower Jump", 
    Where The Gimmick Is That You Move Left And Right With Your Keyboard, But You Jump By Aiming With Your Mouse 
    And Then Clicking To Jump In The Aimed Direction, Which Also Disabled Your Abillity To Move 
    Using The Keyboard Until You Land Again.</br>
    </br>
    The Original Was Level Based, And Had The Player Make Their Way Up A Tall Tower To Reach The End Goal, 
    And In This New Remade Version, You Simply Must Try To Get As High As You Can On The Platfroms 
    Without Falling Into A Rising Sea Of Deadly Lava Below Your Feet.</br>

    This Game Took A Lot Less Time To Make Than My Previous Three Games, And Was A Lot More Simple, 
    However It Is Also The Origin Of My Yellow Cube Avatar And The Theme Of This Website,</br>
    And I Still Had My Fun With It.
