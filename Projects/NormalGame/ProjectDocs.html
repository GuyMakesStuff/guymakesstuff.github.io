    A Normal Game Is Well... A Normal Game! One Day, You Wake Up In A Misterious Place 
    With Checkerboard Walls And Eerie Ventilation Noises, But Everything Is Ok! You Were Not Put Here 
    By Malicious Intent, Probably Just By Accident. You Can Escape The Facillity By Solving A Seires Of Perfectly 
    Normal puzzles With No Tricks Whatsoever! I Promise I Will Guide You To The Way Out, Ok?</br>

    I Originally Made This Game In A Time Where I Still Heavilty Expiremented 
    With Unity And Was Still Learning. Unfortunately, Like All Games From That Time, It Was Never Finished 
    (More About This Time In The <a href="About.html">About</a> Page). A Long Time Later, After Finishing My Game <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=MarketFrenzy">Market Frenzy</a>, 
    When I Knew A Lot More About Game Development, I Remembered The Project And Decided To Remake It!</br>
    </br>
    Inspired By Games Like Portal, The Game Had The Player Find Themselves Trapped In A Misterious Facillity, 
    Where They Must Complete A Series Of Puzzles To Escape, And Are Guided By An Unseen Narrator (Or In This Case, Dialogs On A Screen).</br>
    However, I Wanted To Set The Game Apart. So, I Decided That The Premise Of the Game Is That The Puzzles Are Not What They Seem Like. 
    For Example: Falling Through The Floor To Find A Hidden Passage, Bringing A Box To The Other Side of A Door before It Closes, And More!</br>

    Looking Back On The Game, Despite The Unique Consept, The Game Is Very Flawed.</br>
    The Graphics Are Too Bright, The Dialogs Are Slow, There Are No Checkpoints, And It Is Generally Less Polished. 
    But Hey, It's My Third Most Downloaded Game (At The Time Of Writing), And I Had Fun Making It, So I Can't Complain ;)
