    Number Digger Is A Game Where You Play A game On Your Moms Old Computer,</br>
    Where You Must Click On The Numbers Which Do NOT Appear On The "Real Numbers" 
    List To Get Tresures And Score!</br>
    </br>
    This Game Is My Entry To The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7">Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1</a>, Where The Theme Was:</br>
    "It Is NOT Real". Similarly To The Previous Jam I Have Participated In (Find Out <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=VVV">Here</a>), 
    I Initially Thought The Theme Was Generic, And I Didn't Really Have An Idea On What To Do. So, I Decided Again To Simply Make
    A Regular Game And Find A Way To Implement The Theme Later.</br>
    </br>
    Inspired By Old Windows Games Like Minesweeper And Solitaire, I Had The Idea Of The Player Playing
    An Old Game On An Old Windows 95-98 Computer, Where There Are Buttons With Numbers On A Grid, And The Player
    Must Discover Which Numbers Are Real And Have Tresures Below Them, And Which Ones Don't. The Real Numbers Are Displayed 
    On A List, And If The Player Picks A Fake Number, They Loose! I Still Thought About A Better Way To Implement The Theme,</br>
    And Eventually Decided That The List Of Real Numbers Will Actually Show FAKE Numbers, And The Player Must Avoid Picking Numbers 
    That Appear On The List!</br>

    I Released And Submitted The Game To The Jam A Day Before The Deadline.</br>
    At The Beginning The Game Didn't Do So Well, But By The End Of The Jam It Got Eight Downloads</br>
    And Six Ratings, And Was The Highest Rated Out Of All Of My Previous Jam Entries!</br>
    So Yeah, That Was Fun :)
