    Market Frenzy Is An Intense Game Where You Must Remove Any Dangerous Supply</br>
    From The Delivery Conveyor Belt, While Also Catching The Falling Stock And Cleaning</br>
    Out The Trash Being Thrown At You!</br>
    </br>
    I Got The Idea For The Game From A Wierd Old Game I Found On The Internet, 
    Where The Player Must Collect Falling Choco Milk Cartons While Shooting At Trash That Fall With It.</br>
    If A Choco Milk Is Missed Or Trash Hits The Player, The Player Looses A Life.</br>
    If Trash Is Missed Or A Shot Doesn't Hit Anything, Score Is Decreased.</br>
    I Also Added A Conveyor Belt In The Background That The Player Needs To Remove Bombs From, 
    Without Accidentally Removing Regular Supply.</br>

    I Attempted Many New Things With This Game. I Attempted Achievements, More Complex Gameplay, 
    Trying To Improve My Blender Skills + Generally Making The Game Look Better, And More!</br>

    I Was Working On This Game For Quite A While, And Despite It Getting No Downloads To This Day, 
    And The Games Various Flaws (Like The Lack Of A Proper Player Character or Some Of The Lazy Models), 
    I Had A Lot Of Fun With This Game And I Have learned A Lot From Making It!
