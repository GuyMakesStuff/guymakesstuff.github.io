    This Game Was Made In Less Than 3 Hours. That Is All You need To Know.</br>
    Definitly The Game I Have Ever Made. It Has Graphics, Music, And Gameplay.</br>
    </br>
    There Was (And There Still Is) A Trend In GameDev Youtube Where The Creator Has 
    To Make A Game Under A Short Deadline - A Week, A Day, An Hour, ETC.</br>
    </br>
    I Thought It Would Be Cool To Try Out (Without Intentions Of Uploading To Youtube),</br>
    So I Gave It A Shot. I Chose To Make A 2D Platformer Using My 2D Skill From My Previous Game 
    Because It Was Simple To Make, And Made Only 5 Levels. The Results Were Exactly What You Think They Were. 
    I Don't Even Have The Project Files For It Anymore.</br>

    This Was Still A Fun Challange So I Rate This Game 10 Explosives Out Of 5 Game Of The Year.
