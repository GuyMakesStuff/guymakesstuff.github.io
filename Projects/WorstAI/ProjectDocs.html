    Much Like My <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=3Hours">3 Hour Game</a> Challange, The Title Explains Itself.</br>
    A Small """"AI"""" Chatbot Which Randomly Answers Yes Or No To Any Question You Ask It No Matter The Subject.
    The Only Time It Ever Answers Anything Else Is When No Question Is Entered.</br>
    </br>
    I Remember being Bored After Releasing <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=VVV">VVV</a>, So I Made This In Two Days.</br>
    I Got The Idea From A Wierd Browser Game Where You Ask A Guinea Questions And It Randomly Answers You,
    And Because Of The Randomness It Can Lead To Some "Interesting" Results. Thats All There Really Is To Say.</br>
