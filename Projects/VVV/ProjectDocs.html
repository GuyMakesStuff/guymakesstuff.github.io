    VVV Is A Chaotic Topdown Shooter Where You Play As A V, And 
    You Need To Shoot Bullet V's At Incoming Enemy V's Without Being Hit, To Gain 
    A Total Score Record And Survive For As Long As You Can!</br>

    This Game Is My Entry To The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-6">Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2</a>, Where The Theme Was 
    "Let There Be Chaos". I Initially Thought The Theme Was Generic And I Didn't Really Have Any Idea On What To Do, 
    So I Decided That I Will Simply Make A Regular Game And Make It Chaotic.</br>
    </br>
    For The Gameplay I Wanted To Make A Topdown Endless Shooter Because I Hadn't Done It Before, And For The Visual Style 
    I Decided For A Simplistic Largely Icon Based Visual Style. The Characters Are All Just The Letter V Because 
    I Thought It Kinda Resembled A Spaceship Or A Bullet, And The Game UI Is In The Background To Not Distract From The Gameplay.</br>

    I Ended Up Submitting The Game To The Jam Just A Day Before The Deadline, 
    And It Was Very Well Recieved! The Game Got 14 Downloads And Nine Ratings, 
    Becoming My Most Downloaded Game At The Time! I Also Got A Lot Of Feedback From Players, Which Was Cool.</br>

    Overall, I Had A Lot Of Fun While Making This Game, And I Think It Turned Out Great!</br>
