    Upgrade Dungeon Is A 2D Platformer Where Every Single Abillity That You Have Is An Additional Upgrade:</br>
    Moving Left And Right, Jumping, Dying To Enemies And Spikes, Collecting Coins, Pausing The Game, And Everything Else!</br>
    </br>
    I Got The Idea For This Game From A Game Called <a href="https://joellikespigs.itch.io/ludum-dare-45-you-start-with-nothing">Nothing</a>, 
    A Game Where All of Your Basic Abillities Are Stripped Away, And You Must Get Them Back By Collecting Them As Upgrades.</br>

    I Liked The Game, And So I Decided To Make My Own Version Of It! At The Time I Was Still Using An EDU Website 
    To Create My Games (More In The <a href="About.html">About Page</a>), And For What The Website Had Offered, The Game 
    Was Pretty Good! The Game Had Unlockable Upgrades, A Big Map, And Overall Felt Like A (Somewhat) Serious Game! 
    I Also Decided To Expand Upon The Base Concept Of Nothing, And Added Three Different Types Of Upgrades:</br>
    </br>
    -Input Upgrades For Abillities That Require The Keyboard (Like Jumping Or Moving).</br>
    -General Upgrades Which Grant You Other General Abillities (Like Dying Or Collecting Coins).</br>
    -World Upgrades Which Make Stuff Happen Around You (Like Spawning Powerups).</br>
    </br>

    </br>
    A Long Time After Finishing This Version Of The Game, When I Finally Knew How To</br>
    Develop Proper Games With Unity, I Decided To Remaster The Game. I Didn't Really Change The</br>
    Gameplay, And Kept The Original Level Design As Is, Only Making It A Bit Bigger, However I Did Change 
    The Artstyle And Music To My Own, And Added Some Other Quality Of Life Techincal Features Like A Main Menu 
    And A Game Save System.</br>

    </br>
    This Was The First Game I Have Released In 2022, And Overall I Had A Lot Of Fun Making It.</br>
    Nothing Else To Really Say.
