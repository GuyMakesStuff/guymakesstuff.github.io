    The Game Was Made As Part Of The Summer 2021 <a href="https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2021">"My First Game Jam"</a> - 
    The Second Game Jam I have Participated In. The Theme For This Jam Was "Free". So I Thought About The Idea Of A Free Scam Game 
    Which Promises The Player A Free Prize When They Get To The End, Only To Realize That The Prize Was Fake And Nonexistant.</br>
    </br>
    So, I Began To Work On Such Game In The Form Of An Arcade Style Space Invaders Esque Shooter. Why? Because Why Not. 
    I Have Expiremented With An Arcade-Like Pixel Artstyle, And Also With A Unique Difficulty Progression System
    Including Powerups, Different Enemy Spawn Chances, And Increasing Spawn Rate (Although I May Have Had Set My Ambitions Too Far With That Difficulty One,
    As The Game Ended Up being Very Easy)</br>

    Alas, I Have Submitted The Game To The Jam Two Days Before The Deadline.</br>
    This Time It Was Way Less Successful Than My Previous Jam Entry, As It Got Only Three Downloads
    And One Comment, However It Was The First Game I Have Been Given A Non-Jam Rating For: A Whopping
    Five Stars From The Same Single User That Commented On The Game. I Also Still Liked To Work On This Project :)
