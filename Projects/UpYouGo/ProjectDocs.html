    Up The Way You Go Is A Game Where You Must Stick Yourself Onto Spinning "Platforms", 
    And Then Launch Yourself Upwards From Those Platforms To More Platforms Without Staying In The Air For Too Long 
    And See How High You Can Go!</br>
    There Are Also Sometimes Spikes On Those Platforms Which Kill You, However You Can Also Shoot Upwards 
    To Get Them Out Of Your Way! (Just Dont Run Out Of Ammo!)</br>
    </br>
    I Don't Remember Much About The Development Of This Game. I Remember That I Made It When</br>
    I Had No Other Idea On What To Do, And Probably Thats Why It's Kinda Mediocre And The Reason</br>
    For The Generic Title. It's Also The First Of My many Games To Have A Skins Shop, So Thats Cool.</br>
