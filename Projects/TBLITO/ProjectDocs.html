    The Ball Lost In The Ocean Is A 2.5D Platformer Where You Play As A Ball Stranded In</br>
    The Middle Of The Ocean, And You Must Use Your Special Abillity To Roll Up Walls To Navigate</br>
    The Abandoned Bridges And Reach Your Rescue Helicopter!</br>
    </br>
    The Traditional "Roll A Ball" Game Is Very Simple To Make - Just A Ball With Physics That</br>
    Gets A Force Added To On User Input, That Needs To Reach A Goal Without Falling Off The Track.</br>

    </br>
    With That Being Said, There Is No Suprise Why This Type Of Game Is Very Common On Mobile Game Stores - Where Simple Games Thrive.
    I Remember Playing These Games At Young Age On My Tablet, And When I Have First Learned How To Make Games By Myself, I Gave It Many Tries. All Of Which Have Failed 
    Due To My Lack Of GameDev Knowlage At The Time.</br>
    </br>
    Fast Forward A Long After, When I Had Much More Knowlage On How To Make Games, I Have Decided To Give It Another Try.</br>
    Sure, I Have Made My Game <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=JungleSphereRemade">Jungle Sphere</a> Way Before, However Those "Roll A Ball"</br>
    Games Were Not The Main Inspiration.</br>
    </br>
    The Specific Roll A Ball Game I Was Inspired By Was A 2.5D Platformer Where The Player Is 
    Dropped Off On An Abandoned Structure In The Middle Of The Ocean By A Helicopter To Look For Tresure, And Then Must Go Back To The Helicopter 
    After The Journey. However, I Wanted The Game To Stand Out. So, I Replaced The Jump Mechanic That Was In The Original 
    With The Abillity To Roll On And "Stick" To Walls.</br>

    Overall, Despite The Game Being Pretty Short, I Had A Deacent Time Making It.</br>
    Nothing Else To Really Say.
