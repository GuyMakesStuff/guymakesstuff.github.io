    Snake 3D Is Well... Snake On A 3D Cube Grid!</br>
    To Spice Things Up, The Game Has Several New Features Like Multiple Food Pellets And Bombs You Must Avoid, 
    However You Can Enable "Classic Mode" If You Just Want To Play Normal Snake.</br>

    I Was Programming Snake As Part Of A Python Course, So I Thought I Will Also 
    Give It A Shot In Unity With Some Extra New Features To Make It Stand Out.</br>

    Theres Nothing Else To Really Say. It's Just Regular Snake On A 3D Grid 
    With Some Added Features And A Skins Shop.
