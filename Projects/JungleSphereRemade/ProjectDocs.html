    Jungle Sphere: Remade Is An Endless Runner Where You Must Reach The Tent 
    At The End Of The Track While Dodging The Obstacles That Come In Your Way Like Large Rocks, Wheels, And Other Hazards! 
    There Is Also An Endless Mode If You Dont Want To Reach The Tent And Just Roll Into The Sunset Forever!</br>
    </br>
    As The Title Suggests, This Is A Remake Of My First Ever Finished Game "Jungle Sphere", Which Isn't On This Website, 
    However You Can Find Out About It In The <a href="About.html">About Page</a>. And With My Most Reacent 
    Game At The Time - <a href="ProjectView.html?ProjectID=NormalGame">"A Normal Game"</a> Being A Remake Of An Old Project As Well,</br>
    I Decided To Continue The Trend And Remake The Game That Started It All.</br>
    </br>
    The Game Is A Fully Fledged PROPER Remake, Which Transforms What Was Once A Crude Joke ""Game"" Into A Completly Different Experience, 
    With Brand New Features Including But Not Limited To:</br>
    </br>
    -Multiple Obstacle Types.</br>
    -Actual Random Level Generation (In The Original The Level Was Always The Same).</br>
    -Better Graphics.</br>
    -Actual Music.</br>
    -More Content.</br>
    -And Much More!</br>

    The Game Does A Great Job At Improving On What The Original Had To Offer,</br>
    And While It Does Have It's Flaws, I Had Much Fun Making It!
